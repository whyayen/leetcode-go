This is my repository for practicing Leetcode problems using Golang.

## How to run
Clone the project, and run the file which problem you wanna to try like this way:
```shell
go run implement_trie.go
```

## How to know which file corresponds to which problem
Copy the title of the problem on LeetCode, then search it with git log
```shell
git log --all --grep="208. Implement Trie"
git show --name-only 0d1c89e7168bbeed39da80937388e6107b5291c7
```
